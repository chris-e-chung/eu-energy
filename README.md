## Overview

Start with big trade overview (basically done)

Zoom in onto Germany as a case study in energy production, show German energy production (line graphs or something)

We'll probably see a dip in production/trade in 2019;
When we scroll after the initial line chart, make a vertical line on the date of the Russian war

Shift focus to Russia / Ukraine; Highlight its huge oil/natural gas;

Play with yourself
