<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About This Project

[![EU Energy example][example]](https://chrischung.dev/eu-energy/)

EU Energy is an scroll-to-interact visualization that shows the user energy trade and production in Europe, built using D3.js.

What I learned from the challenges of this project:

- Repeating D3 transitions, using global bools and tracking active setTimeout and .transition functions to cancel their repetition when needed.

- Naming D3 transitions to control interference and interruption between simultaneous animations.

- Calculating when to animate elements on a `<path>` by keeping track of their summed distances to eachother and adding a delay based on that.

- Animating elements in and out after initializing the page.

<!-- - Optimizing for mobile-view. -->

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

In no particular order:

- [ ] Comparative Bar Charts
- [ ] Trade Link Numbers
- [ ] Toggle (Line Chart) Animations
- [x] ~~Mobile View~~
- [ ] Split up the Russia-Ukraine section into two parts, one that storytells Crimea and another that shows the chart
- [ ] Images for storytelling on the left
